# hello-world
/*
  Greetings.
  This is a guy who is passionate about learning programming. Sometimes, I have some interesting and crazy ideas, but since I am just a beginner, thinking is the only thing I can do for now. However, as I learn more from the internet and from friends in Github, the other day, I can achieve my goals. Wish me good luck.
  I'd love to talk, so feel free to talk to me.
  Farewell.
  
  Joel
